                    Our Company has launched a new product. But we’re spending so much fixing our supply chain? How can you help!
                </h3>
                <p class="answer">
                    Congrats on your new product line. The key is to understand what’s more valuable for your business at this current stage. <br> <br> 
                    Does your supply chain bring more value & profit In the long run? or, does your new product show more profitability that allows you take the burn for a short period of time? <br> <br>

                    Our latest marketing campaign didn’t go as well as we had planned. How can you help?
                </h3>
                <p class="answer">
                    A key piece of advice - all campaigns usually boost your sales only about 10% (Directly). It’s important to not compare your average sales figures directly with your post campaign sales period. <br> <br>
                    Your focus should be on making campaigns that have high retention & brand recall value. <br> <br> This can contribute to your sales indirectly as well. Analysing the parameters in a short span usually doesn’t help. <br> <br> 
                    We can help you design your campaigns that cater to different consumer segments, testing, feedback & more. Write to us and we’ll help you fix this.
